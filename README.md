# AI-Sync

An intelligent daemon-based AI assistant that runs seamlessly in your operating system, ready to help you with any task at a moment's notice.

## Overview

AI-Sync is a revolutionary application designed to run as a background daemon on your operating system. Unlike traditional AI assistants that require you to navigate through user interfaces, AI-Sync can be summoned instantly to assist with any task, making AI interaction as natural as calling a system service.

## Vision

The initial intent of this project was to automate the process of navigating user interfaces. However, our approach has evolved beyond traditional UI automation. Instead of requiring users to interact with complex interfaces, AI-Sync provides direct AI assistance through simple invocation - eliminating the need for UI navigation entirely.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Daemon-based Architecture**: Runs silently in the background, consuming minimal system resources
- **Instant Invocation**: Call upon AI assistance whenever needed without opening applications
- **System Integration**: Deep integration with your operating system for seamless workflow
- **Task Automation**: Intelligent assistance for any task, from simple queries to complex workflows
- **No UI Required**: Direct interaction with AI capabilities without the overhead of graphical interfaces

## Current Status
